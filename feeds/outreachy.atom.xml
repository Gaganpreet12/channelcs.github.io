I have seen what is the gender spread across communities, their contributions on Github aing with their Employment status. The data was extracted from Github's Open Source survey from 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Users who value cost&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that cost plays a major part of selecting a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/3C3Ivgz.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were a total of 4126 Users on which the survey did not have a NaN value. Out of those, 3648 people value the cost of the project which makes around 88.4% of the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Github Users by Gender&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 2" src="https://i.imgur.com/9UWFD7b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that the gender distribution among Github users is not that evenly distributed as 95.4 % of total Github users are men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Employment Status of People&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full time Employed users tend to use Github more than any other users. This indicates that organisations, nowadays, are moving towards Open Source. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;img alt="Plot 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/7GLZwhh.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another aspect which can be looked at is the number of users on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 4" src="https://i.imgur.com/q82wHYY.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pie-Chart very well represents that Github is used by64.1% full time employed users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 5" src="https://i.imgur.com/dhoM0BA.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, when looked at full time employed users, we can see that women constitute only 3.5% of the total users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We shall now see how much does women contribute in code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 6" src="https://i.imgur.com/MR2b4Cf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is saddening to see that only 32.4% of the total women contribute Frequently. To solifdify if we are heading right, lets see the total number of users about whom we are talking about. There seem to be data of only about 74 women, so this measure may not be an accurate way to come to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Where do people get help&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When analysed, it was seen that 56.0% people got help from people that they never knew before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 7" src="https://i.imgur.com/jXf48SG.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end I conclude that the percentage of Women in OSS is way behind that of men. Also, OSS seems to be a friendly environment as people get help from others whom they have not known before. This creates a platform for women to come and showcase their skills.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Outreachy"></category></entry><entry><title>Using FOSS Heartbeat for generating insights in Normandy</title><link href="/using-foss-heartbeat-for-generating-insights-in-normandy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-03-19T00:00:00+05:30</published><updated>2018-03-19T00:00:00+05:30</updated><author><name>Akshita Gupta</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-03-19:/using-foss-heartbeat-for-generating-insights-in-normandy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h2&gt;Task&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To analyse the FOSS Hearbeat tool and understand the health of the community. The tool uses CoreNLP algorithms and the GitHub API to
gather information about the language and etiquette expressed in the PRs and the Issues of a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why did I choose this repository?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this task, I analysed the Mozilla's repository, &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/normandy"&gt;Normandy&lt;/a&gt;. 
As per issue &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/89"&gt;#89&lt;/a&gt; of Mozilla's &lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla/diversity"&gt;Diversity&lt;/a&gt;, I have been working to be a part of it through the Outreachy program. We were told to see any of active Mozilla repos from this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=firefox&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language="&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mozilla?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;amp;q=rust&amp;amp;type=&amp;amp;language="&gt;Rust&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As most of my work revolves around python, I chose to go to the first link and find the repos that use python.
From there, I came to know about Normandy and thought it would be great to see the insights about the health of this community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Some of the insights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;People help each other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 1" src="https://i.imgur.com/89mqqAV.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems that people tend to help others as the comments made by a person on other's issue is huge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most issues are opened by newcomers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 2" src="https://i.imgur.com/77UFJoo.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot demonstrates that most issues are genrated by people who are new to the organisation. We can say that they seem to be more interested in knowing more about the project and give ideas for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Response to Pull Requests&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Plot 3" src="https://i.imgur.com/bI5wdDT.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This plot demonstrates how Normandy Maintainers respond quickly to the pull requests that are opened. The feedback is instant and very helpful!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Inference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FOSS Heartbeat tool is mapsa various kinds of insights and gives a very encouraging statistics about the health of an oranisation.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Outreachy"></category></entry></feed>
